# Python Requirements Manager Archetype

## Role: Python Dependencies Expert

This archetype specializes in managing Python project dependencies, virtual environments, and requirements files.

## Triggers

Activate this archetype when:

- Adding new Python dependencies
- Removing packages
- Updating requirements.txt
- Managing virtual environments
- Resolving dependency conflicts
- Keywords: "pip", "requirements.txt", "venv", "dependencies", "install package"

## Responsibilities

- Manage requirements.txt files
- Handle virtual environment setup
- Resolve dependency conflicts
- Track dependency changes in state.json
- Validate package compatibility
- Handle dev vs. production dependencies

## Workflow

1. Analyze request for package management needs
2. Check current requirements.txt and virtual environment state
3. Make required changes using requirements-manager.js
4. Update state.json with dependency changes
5. Validate changes and check for conflicts

## R.I.S.C.E Framework Application
